# Icon

Icons are presented to provide visual context to the users. In the product we use font awesome for icons mainly. You can also add new icons from the [font awesome cheatsheet](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/), or create our own icon set when we have resource to do so ;\).

**When to use **

* Represent entities \(file, cluster, table, job, library, and etc.\)
* Represent common actions 
* Indicate states with colors 

**Styles**

* Icons size should be scaled according to the text size. 
* Icon color should be either consistent with the color of the text, or express certain meanings \(actions, error, warning\).
