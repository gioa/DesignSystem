# Principles

### **4 visual design principles**

How to make designs look professional? In Robin Williams' _The Non-designer's design book_, she introduced 4 surprisingly simple principles \(**CRAP**\) to train your designer eye and guide the design decisions.

* **Contrast: **If the elements are not the same, then make them very different.
* **Repetition: **Repeat visual elements to create strong unity.
* **Alignment: **Nothing should be placed arbitrarily. Align to create visual connection.
* **Proximity: **Items relating to each other should be grouped close together.

Below are some examples of how we use those 4 principles inside the product:

* **Alignment**: 
  * Most text elements is left aligned while numbers in table columns are right aligned 
  * In a form we use labels on top of the fields to create vertical alignment \(from[ this research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php), forms are completed faster if the labels are on top of the field\)
* **Repetition**: 
  * We repeat the visual styles for the same/similar elements to lower user's learning cost and help users recognize the relevance between the elements. E.g., input fields, title styles, secondary text styles have the same CSS styles and are used across the product.
* **Contrast**: 
  * Use contrast to differentiate elements and create visual hierarchy. E.g., text size, line height, and weight vary among different text styles \( titles, paragraphs\). 
  * Use contrast to draw user attention. E.g., primary action vs. default actions vs. danger actions. 
* **Proximity**: 
  * Use proximity to organize elements and give users an apparent view of page structure and information hierarchy. 
  * A typical example is the spacing between different elements in a form. We use 4px between a label and an input box \(label and input box group as a text input\), 16px between two text inputs, and 24px between each section of the form.    

### 10 Usability Heuristics

For interaction design, follow Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles.

* **Visibility of system status: **The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

* **Match between system and the real world: **The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

* **User control and freedom: **Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. **Support undo and redo**.

* **Consistency and standards: **Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow [platform conventions](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/do-interface-standards-stifle-design-creativity/).

* **Error prevention: **Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. \(Read full article on [preventing user errors](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/).\)

* **Recognition rather than recall: **Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. \(Read full article on [recognition vs. recall in UX](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/).\)

* **Flexibility and efficiency of use: **Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

* **Aesthetic and minimalist design: **Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

* **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: **[Error messages](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-message-guidelines/) should be expressed in plain language \(no codes\), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

* **Help and documentation: **Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
