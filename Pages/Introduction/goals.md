# Goals

This doc serves as a reference guide for stakeholders \(PMs, designers, and engineers\) to discuss our progress towards a design system.

### What's design system

* Living style guide
* Design language
* Pattern library / UI components
* UI framework 

### Why do we need one

* Ensure consistent, seamless experience across the product
* Reduce inefficiencies
  * Too many small decision making during development 
  * Designer spend time in redline spec
  * Engineers spend time in interpret redline specs and tweak the pixels with designers
* Address technical / design debts
  * Hard coding values for colors, spacings, widths and etc
  * Inconsistent styles/interaction details  
* Remove knowledge silos

### The ultimate goals

* Provide a unified language and consistent look and feel within the Databrick ecosystem
* Developers focus on application logic while designers focus on user experience and flows \(instead of pixels\)
* A team independent of the design system team can ship/translate/interpret the system with no guidance

### Our approach

* Document all the element styles, how to use and why
* Build UI components implementing the styles properly
* Iterate towards a design system
